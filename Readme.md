# Text-to-Image Generation

This project is a web-based application that converts text prompts into high-quality images. By leveraging advanced transformer models and diffusion techniques, the application allows users to generate images from descriptive text. The project utilizes Hugging Face's models, Transformers, and Diffusers to enable the text-to-image conversion. Built with React and Express, this project serves as a full-stack website.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to input a descriptive text prompt (such as "a mountain landscape at sunset") and receive a generated image based on the provided text. The underlying model is trained on vast datasets of images and captions, enabling it to understand and replicate various visual styles, objects, and scenes based on textual descriptions.

## Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Convert text prompts into unique images.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly frontend built with React.
- **Scalable Backend**: Backend API built with Express for handling requests.
- **Image Customization Options** (future feature): Control parameters like image resolution and style.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Used for building the user interface, handling state, and managing components.

### Backend
- **Express**: Serves as the RESTful API to handle prompt requests and send responses.
- **JavaScript**: Language used for frontend and backend development.

### AI/ML
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Transformer models for natural language understanding and processing.
- **Hugging Face Diffusers**: Diffusion models for generating images from text prompts.

### Others
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for backend development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-image-generation.git
   cd text-to-image-generation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your Hugging Face API key and other configurations as needed.

4. **Start the application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter a text prompt in the input field.
3. Click the "Generate" button.
4. The application will generate and display an image based on your prompt.
